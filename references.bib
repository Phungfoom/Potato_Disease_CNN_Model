   abstract = {In this paper, we address the question of achieving high accuracy in deep learning models for agricultural applications through edge computing devices while considering the associated resource constraints. Traditional and state-of-the-art models have demonstrated good accuracy, but their practicality as end-user available solutions remains uncertain due to current resource limitations. One agricultural application for deep learning models is the detection and classification of plant diseases through image-based crop monitoring. We used the publicly available PlantVillage dataset containing images of healthy and diseased leaves for 14 crop species and 6 groups of diseases as example data. The MobileNetV3-small model succeeds in classifying the leaves with a test accuracy of around 99.50%. Post-training optimization using quantization reduced the number of model parameters from approximately 1.5 million to 0.93 million while maintaining the accuracy of 99.50%. The final model is in ONNX format, enabling deployment across various platforms, including mobile devices. These findings offer a cost-effective solution for deploying accurate deep-learning models in agricultural applications.},

   abstract = {Accurate detection of apple leaf diseases remains a critical challenge in precision agriculture, where complex field conditions and subtle symptom variations often degrade model performance. This paper introduces a novel hybrid architecture combining enhanced spatial attention with edge-aware feature extraction to improve disease classification robustness. The proposed model integrates a multi-scale feature fusion module to capture both local lesion patterns and global contextual cues, while a lightweight attention mechanism dynamically prioritizes disease-relevant regions. Experiments on a curated dataset of 12,350 apple leaf images demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed approach, achieving 96.7% classification accuracy across six disease categories - a significant improvement over baseline models like EfficientNet-B4 (94.1%) and ResNet-50 (93.8%). The system particularly excels in detecting early-stage infections, showing 15% higher precision for subtle scab lesions compared to existing methods. With only 3.2 million parameters, the model maintains practical deployment potential for edge devices in orchard environments. These advances address key limitations in current vision-based plant disease detection systems while balancing accuracy and computational efficiency for real-world agricultural applications.},
