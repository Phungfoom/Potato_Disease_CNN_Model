# About The Project
Potato_Disease_CNN_Model
A CNN model to perform image classification on potatoes to detect diseases. Models stability will be tested by adding channels, first with just RGB for a baseline. 
Added channels: 
(1) Texture, sobel edge magnitude: Can model detect edges of diesase spread?
(2) Grayscale: Can model handle redundant information?
(3) Gaussian Noise: Can model ignore useless information?
